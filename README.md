### README.ish
Todo:
   * As a user, I want to add a recipe with ingredients and instructions, so I remember how to prepare my favorite dishes.
   * As a user, I want to rate my recipes, so I know which ones are the best.
 
   * As a user, I want to list my recipes by highest rated so I can see which ones I like the best.
   * As a user, I want to see all recipes that use a certain ingredient, so I can more easily find recipes for the ingredients I have.

implemented:
   * As a user, I want to tag my recipes with different categories, so recipes are easier to find. A recipe can have many tags and a tag can have many recipes.
   * As a user, I want to be able to update and delete tags, so I can have flexibility with how I categorize recipes.
   * As a user, I want to be able to delete recipes I don't like or use, so I don't have to see them as choices.
   * As a user, I want to edit my recipes, so I can make improvements or corrections to my recipes.



## How To Run This Project

### Install Tools

Install the tools that are introduced in [this series of lessons on LearnHowToProgram.com](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c).

If you have not already, install the `dotnet-ef` tool by running the following command in your terminal:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0
```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList".
3. Within the production directory "ToDoList", create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `root` and the `pwd` is `epicodus`.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=to_do_list_with_auth;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```

5. Create the database using the migrations in the To Do List project. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) to the production directory "ToDoList", and run `dotnet ef database update`. 
    - To optionally create a migration, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName` where `MigrationName` is your custom name for the migration in UpperCamelCase. To learn more about migrations, visit the LHTP lesson [Code First Development and Migrations](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/many-to-many-relationships/code-first-development-and-migrations).
6. Within the production directory "ToDoList", run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).
